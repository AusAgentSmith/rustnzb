# Releasing rustnzb

GitHub is the release authority for rustnzb. Release tags use the `vX.Y.Z`
format and must point to a commit reachable from `main`.

## Release channels

The container image is published to GHCR (`…/rustnzbd`) on three tag channels:

- **`:latest`** — the current stable release. Moved only by a stable
  `vX.Y.Z` release.
- **`:beta`** — the newest pre-release, for soak testing before a stable
  promotion. A pre-release tag **never** moves `:latest`.
- **`:vX.Y.Z`** / **`:vX.Y.Z-beta.N`** — immutable, one per tag.

Pre-release tags use a suffix: `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` (also `-rc.N` / `-alpha.N`).
They are flagged as GitHub pre-releases and publish only `:vX.Y.Z-beta.N` and
`:beta`. Cutting a pre-release tag is how a build enters soak testing.

## Beta soak and promotion

Prefer shipping a stable release only after a pre-release has soaked:

1. Tag a pre-release on a `main` commit, e.g. `v1.5.0-beta.1`, and push it.
   The release workflow publishes `:v1.5.0-beta.1` + `:beta` and a GitHub
   pre-release. `:latest` is untouched.
2. Let it soak. Bump the suffix (`-beta.2`, …) for fixes during soak.
3. When satisfied, run the **Promote pre-release to stable** workflow
   (`workflow_dispatch`) with the soaked tag. It copies the **exact image
   digest** that soaked to `:v1.5.0` + `:latest`, then rebuilds the standalone
   release binaries from the same commit and publishes the stable GitHub
   release.

Because promotion copies the soaked image by digest, `:v1.5.0` is byte-identical
to the beta that was tested; only the tag changes. The image's own embedded
build ref therefore still reads the pre-release version it was built as — that
is the promoted lineage, not a rebuild. The standalone binaries are rebuilt and
carry the stable version.

A stable `vX.Y.Z` tag pushed directly (a hotfix without soak) still works and
takes the rebuild path below.

## Release checklist

1. Update the workspace version in `Cargo.toml` and any user-visible version
   metadata.
2. Run the checks in [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
3. Merge the release change to `main` through a reviewed pull request.
4. Create and push an annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag on that `main` commit.
5. Monitor the GitHub Actions release workflow.
6. Verify the GitHub release assets, checksums, and multi-architecture GHCR
   image:

   ```text
   ghcr.io/thedancingdeveloper-org/rustnzbd:vX.Y.Z
   ghcr.io/thedancingdeveloper-org/rustnzbd:latest
   ```

GitHub generates release notes from the tagged history. Review them before
publishing; do not add version-specific release-note files to the repository.

## Standalone nzb-* crates

The seven `nzb-*` crates under `crates/` are published to crates.io from
standalone repositories (one per crate, named in `ci/nzb-crates.txt`, URL in
each crate's `repository` field). This monorepo is the head:

- **The monorepo owns version numbers.** Change a crate's `version` only in
  `crates/<name>/Cargo.toml`; the standalone repos never originate a bump.
  Keep each new version strictly above the crates.io maximum for that crate.
- **Standalone repos are sync targets.** `ci/tasks/sync-crate <name>` exports
  `crates/<name>` at `HEAD` and opens a pull request on that crate's standalone
  repo. It never publishes and never pushes to the monorepo.
- **Publish only from a synced tag.** After a sync PR merges, publish that
  crate from a `vX.Y.Z` tag on the standalone repo — never from an out-of-sync
  tree.
- **Drift is gated.** The scheduled `crate-drift` job
  (`.github/workflows/quality-schedule.yml`, via `ci/tasks/crate-drift`) fails
  when any standalone repo's `src/` or package version differs from the
  monorepo. A failure means a crate changed here without a sync; run
  `ci/tasks/sync-crate <name>`, merge, and publish from the tag.

## Rollback

Do not move or replace a published tag. Revert the faulty change on `main`,
release a new patch version, and publish a new tag. Operators should pin an
immutable image tag rather than relying on `latest` for controlled rollouts.
